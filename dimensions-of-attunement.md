# Dimensions of Attunement

Here, I will describe three dimensions of attunement that are important in this process: **attunement to self (of the therapist), attunement to the relational field, and attunement to the vibrational field**.

## Attunement to Self of the Therapist

In non-directive psychotherapy, the therapist also seeks to connect with **their own inner healing intelligence**.

Just as the client is instructed to enter into a receptive state of mindfulness in the beginning of the session, using their breath and the music, the therapist also shifts into a more receptive space, allowing the surround of the room to impact them and noticing the details of their sensory experience—quality of breathing, posture, sounds, smells, etc.

## Attunement to the Client and the Relational Field

Once connected with their self-experience, the therapist seeks to attune to the client’s experience.

In these sessions, the aim is to let the client’s inner healing intelligence guide the process; the therapist seeks to be non-directive and follow the client’s lead. As such, the therapist must often rely on non-verbal perceptive and intuitive capacities rather than dialectical engagements, such as interpretation or meaning making.

Music is also a source of support for the therapist in the psychedelic therapy session. **To the extent that both the therapist and the client are open to allowing the music to move them, a sharing of vibrational frequencies is possible, helping the therapist to stay attuned and in sync with the client’s process.**

It is helpful to stay open to ways in which **the beat, the melody, and the rhythm of the music are tuning and calibrating the corporeal instruments of the psyche–soma of both the therapist and the client**.

> In music theory, the term resonance describes the phenomenon of the sharing of vibrational frequencies between two separate bodies. For example, when two guitars are placed in close proximity to each other and a note is played only on one of them, the other will resonate, humming in the same note.

Similarly, empathic attunement is facilitated by mirror neurons in resonance with the other.

Resonating is a non-verbal dimension of relating and of empathizing, which holds the capacity to change the frequency of the other.

> It might be helpful to consider each psychedelic therapy session as a meeting of two subjects attempting to make music together.

As in music, so in therapy—attention to emergent qualities of the session, such as call and response, timing, tone, intonation, and rhythm, is needed to effectively attune, resonate, and harmonize.

What might be happening for them and how might they be expressing aspects of their process? Are they holding their breath, or is there a deepening of breath or a sigh? What unspoken meanings or feelings are being expressed through tone or intonation of the voice? What might they be sensing, feeling, seeing, and dreaming?

In attuning to the relational field, the therapist and the client are resonating, syncing their vibrational tones, frequencies, and rhythms.

## Attunement to the Shared Vibrational Field

Finally, we can attune to the vibrational field, which is inherently shared and connecting. Music is a tool for synchronization of two or more bodies and is highly efficient in synchronizing movement (Repp, 2005), emotions (Juslin & Laukka, 2008), and even physiological responses such as heart rate and blood pressure (Czepiel et al., 2021).

The rhythm of the listener’s heartbeat actually entrains to the rhythm of the music, almost as if the body is being calibrated and tuned to the frequency of the vibrational field. The potential for the therapist and the client to **merge through shared awareness of sensory phenomena**, such as music — what psychoanalyst Peter Goldberg refers to as “sensory symbiosis” — can be overlooked in psychotherapy.

As Goldberg (2012) explains, “In the act of jointly perceiving an object, one is rendered experientially indistinguishable from the other” (p. 796). He uses the example of gazing with a client upon various items in his office, together noticing the details and patterns within them, and making contact through curiosity and appreciation of sensory data, without having to make sense of it together through language.

> The sense of connection, in this case, was not created through meaning making but more primarily through “a shared location of attention.”
